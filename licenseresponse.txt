We chose our License because it was relatively modern with a good amount of positives and only a few limitations. It also seemed simpler than some of the other ones and more manageable. Another reason for choosing this license because modifications of the source code itself must be redistributed under the license, but software that just includes does not need to be under the license. This seems to strike a fair balance between being completely open source and making the project licensed. 

We chose to use a modified version of the Contributer Covenant for our Code of Conduct. This CoC can be used for projects of any sides, while other conduct templates are generally for larger projects. The Covenant is also very thorough when it comes to being inclusive and it provides good examples of what to do and what not to do. We added a few positive and negative activites, such as saying you should be a Pittsburgh sports fan to participate in the project, to made the Code of Conduct a little lighter and give a more unique personality.

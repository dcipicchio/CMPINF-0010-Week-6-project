# CMPINF-0010-Week-6-project
This program was created by myself, Caleb Benton, and Daulton Cipicchio.
This program asks the user for their name and their favorite color.
The system then print their name and their favorite color, with a twist ;).
This code is very basic, and when we explain it, you will understand why.
For someone running the code, all you have to do is run it, and type your name and your favorite color.
Downloading Code

A. py -m pip install --upgrade pip
B. py -m pip install jupyter
3. to run use this command:
A. py -m notebook
You now have Python installed and can run our code.
4. When on GitHub, simply search dcipiccho / Cmpinf-0010-Week-6-project
There will be an option to clone or download our code. If you wish to edit it, clone it. To run it exclusively, download it.
5. Congratulations, now you can run our code.

-What exactly does the code do?
Our code prompts the user for two basic things, their name and favorite color.
When the code is run, you will see a statement printed on the screen.
This statement was designed by us, using the print command. print("hello" + "nameinput" + "welcome to the color selection program.")
"input" allows the user to submit their own data and it will be used in the program.
By using more print statements, we are able to print out our own text, and the user input.
The \n at the end of the line indicates a new line.
You may edit our code and make it better or input your own ideas and then propose a change to us.
To do this, go the same route you did to download, and instead of pressing download, simply press on our code and propose a file change.
-Thank you and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.
Enjoy.
